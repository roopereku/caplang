# Cap Lang

Cap (Convenient All-Purpose) Lang is a programming language that aims to be
memory safe and exception safe

## Usage

`git clone https://github.com/roopereku/caplang.git`

`cd caplang; mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make`

Run `captest` and for an example pass `test.cap` as an argument

## Plans

The language and compiler are at a really early stage so there
is a lot of progress to be made

- Compile an ELF binary
- Write examples
- Detect basic memory safety issues
- Perform basic optimizations
- Add cool features
